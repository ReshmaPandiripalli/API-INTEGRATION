Description of the project:

Overview
This project is a simple, responsive webpage that dynamically fetches and displays real-time weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API. It demonstrates how to integrate a public API into a web application, making it a great example for beginners learning API handling, JavaScript fetch requests, and dynamic content updates.

Features
User Input for City Search: Users can enter a city name in the input field to retrieve weather details.
Real-Time API Fetching: The application sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieves current weather data.
Dynamic Data Display: The webpage updates dynamically to show city name, temperature, and weather conditions.
Error Handling: The script manages errors such as incorrect city names or network issues, displaying appropriate messages.
Responsive Design: The webpage adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a user-friendly experience on desktops and mobile devices.
Technology Stack
HTML: Provides the structure for the webpage, including input fields, buttons, and result display sections.
CSS: Basic styling for readability and user experience.
JavaScript (Fetch API): Handles API requests and dynamically updates the webpage with fetched data.
How It Works
The user enters a city name in the input field and clicks the "Get Weather" button.
A JavaScript function constructs an API request URL, inserting the user's input and an API key.
The application fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API asynchronously.
If the request is successful, the weather information is displayed, including:
City name and country
Temperature in Celsius
Weather condition (e.g., "Clear sky," "Rainy," etc.)
If there is an error (e.g., invalid city name), a corresponding message is shown to the user.
Potential Enhancements
Geolocation Integration: Automatically detect the userâ€™s location and fetch weather details.
5-Day Forecast: Display future weather predictions.
UI Improvements: Add animations, icons, or graphs for a better user experience.
Multiple API Integration: Fetch additional details like air quality, UV index, or wind speed from other sources.
